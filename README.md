This project uses <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/forest-cover-type-prediction">this dataset</a> 

As for an environment manager I used conda,  feel free to download conva_env.yaml

to save a model use 
```sh
python saving.py save
```
save supports n_estimators number as the first arg and max_depth as the second
for example, you can specify it as 
```sh
python saving.py save(340, 53)
```
right from the root folder
